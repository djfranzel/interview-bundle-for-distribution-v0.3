# Python Line Protocol Coding Interview

This coding exercise is intended to help us to begin to understand:

* How you approach implementing solutions given a set of requirements,
* Your coding style, fluency and comfort level.

There are 3 files:

* `README.md`: This file,
* `interview.py`: The file where you will implement your task,
* `data.log`: A set of sample data for parsing,
* `test.py`: The testing code that you run (and edit).

Please read through the files above in order to ensure that you understand the task.

To run against the sample data:
```
cat data.log | python interview.py
```
To run the tests:
```
python test.py
```
Neither of the above will work until you implement the code though. :) 

Please ask questions if you would like any clarification!

## Interview Guide

* We encourage you to share your screen and to talk through your approach as you-go
(just as you may do in a pair programming session).

However, we recognize that sometimes it can be easier to focus in isolation, so
if it helps, you are welcome to turn off your camera as you work through the task.

* You should plan to complete the task in 40 minutes, so adjust your ambitions accordingly.

* You will not be able to do everything you want to within that time, so please leave
comments that indicate future extensions. e.g.,
```
def foo(x: int):
    # TODO: Handle overflow
    return x ** 1000
```
